A simple and fun game created as a learning project for my child. 
Each time the page loads, it generates 100 random-colored balls in different positions without overlapping. 
The colors are selected from an array of 12 available options. 
This project demonstrates techniques such as CSS styling, loops (for), arrays, and JavaScript functions like push and random.
